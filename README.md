For run this code you have to install some required libraries.


use this commands:

pip install flask

pip install deepgram-sdk

pip install asyncio

pip install aiohttp_wsgi



after run the main.py file.
if it is deploy successfully then Open web browser and write 
http://localhost:5555

then click on start button and give the Microphone Permission to web browser and start speaking

it will show you Realtime output on browser.
